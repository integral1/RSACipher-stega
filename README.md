## 🔐 RSA Video Steganography

**RSA Video Steganography** is a Java-based software application that implements secure video steganography using **RSA encryption**. The system enables encryption of video content, embedding of the encrypted data within an image, and later extraction and decryption, ensuring confidentiality and data concealment.

> 📌 This work has been formally **published** in an academic journal, showcasing its relevance in the field of secure multimedia communication and cryptographic data hiding.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **RSA Key Pair Generation**
   The application automatically generates an RSA key pair (public and private keys) at runtime.

    * **Private Key** is used to encrypt the video content.
    * **Public Key** is used to decrypt the data for validation and testing purposes.

2. **Encryption**
   The video is encrypted using the generated private key to secure the content before embedding.

3. **Embedding**
   The encrypted video is hidden within a cover image using steganographic techniques.

4. **Extraction & Decryption**
   The hidden content is extracted from the image and decrypted using the public key, restoring the original video file for the receiver.

# RSA VIDEO STEGANOGRAPHY 
A software application written in Java to implement video steganography with RSA. The program generates an RSA key pair (public and private keys) to encrypt a video (message) using the private key, embeds the encrypted video into a steganographic (cover) image, extracts the hidden video from the steganographic image, decrypts the extracted video, and saves it to a file for the receiver's access.

# Video Files
Some of the contained video files were used to evaluate the software. 

# Public key and Private key
Public key and private key in this project can also be used to carry out the encryption and decryption.

# JAR File 
This project also contains the jar file inside the build folder, launch to see how the system works.
